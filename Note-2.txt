e.g: class

Constructor

Q1. Need to initialize the member variable when object is construct/create.
Ans: We need constructor for this.

- constructor is call when you create an object
- So constructor will initialize the member variable
- constructor name is same as class name
- constructor never return anything
- It is called only once
- One class can have multiple constructors, so this thing is called constructor overloading
- Every class by default have default constructor
- So if you create any other constructor the default one is killed

constructor has types:

1. default constructor
2. parameterized constructor

This keyword: It can hold current object's reference

1. To differentiate the instance and local varibales

2. To use default and parameterized constructor at a time

When we need multiple constructor calls in a sinle call
sol: we need constructor chaining for this.
this keyword also use for constructor chaining

What is Package in java?

- Package is a collection of classess, interfaces
- We divide a big problem into small-2 packages
- So we can group the similar code in same kind of packages
