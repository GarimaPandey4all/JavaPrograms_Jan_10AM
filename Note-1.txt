2 major types of programming

- procedural: Functions - Divide a problem into functions - C programming
- oops: wrap all the variables and functions into a single unit - class


In c programming

class A
{

int x, y;

add()
{}

sub()
{}

div()
{}

mul()
{}

}

class B
{
sin()
{
	double x;
}
}


Is java has global variable?
- No, because in java every program start with class, and class doesn't have global variable.

What is OOPS?

- Divide a big problem into classes.
OOPS Features:

1. class , object

object: real time entity, physical entity

e.g: a/c, car, fan, almirah
e.g: amit, ram, shyam 

class: collection of similar objects, logical entity, category, blueprint
- collection of features/characteristics
e.g: human (features brain, height, weight, 2 ears)
object: ram state brain sharp, 6 feet height


OOAD: Object Oriented Analysis and Design

- To make your code clean
- OOAD provides SOLID Principle

SOLID

Problem:

1. Duplicacy in Program

D: DRY- Don't Repeat Yourself
Copy Paste alternative create a function and call it 

2. Security of the Code

- make your data members private

This keyword:

- It can holds current object's reference
