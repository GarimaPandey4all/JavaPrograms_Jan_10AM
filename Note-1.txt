Creating a first program in java

- Every java program start with class
- Class name should start with capital letter
- Class name should be same as file name
- Class name starts with either alphabet or special symbol(_, $)

javac (javac Example.java) - java code compile
java (java Hello) - run/execute the java code

main method

- main is an entry point of every java program
- without main java will compile the code and convert it into byte code but it can't execute the code or interpret 
the code

4 types of scopes in java

- public: global, which is accessible for all from anywhere
- private: accessible within the class only
- protected: can be accessed outside the package/folder by using inheritance, but also accessed inside the same package
- default: It is not a reserved keyword, if you will not specify any scope then it is default. The scope can be 
accessed by any class but within same package

why main is public?

- JRE uses main
- java command trigger the JRE
- JRE load class in the memory
- JRE is looking for main
- JRE is outside from your directory and outside the package things can access

Why main is static?

- static things are loaded into memory when class is loaded

why main is void?

- null or nothing or empty
- main is void in nature
- main is entry point so there is no need to return anything

main arguments - String[] args

- main has command line arguments
- we can pass any number of arguments, that's why it is array
- All arguments are pass to main in form of array of String

What is String?

- It is a collection of characters
- It is internally a char[]
- String is a predefined class in java as it is in capital letter


What is System.out.println?

- println(): print in new line, println comes from out object
- out: out is a predefined object, which belongs to PrintStream class
- System: System is a predefined class used for input, output, error
e.g: System.in, System.out, System.err

Println vs print

- println: print in new line
- print: here cursor remains at the end of the text


Can we overload main()?

- yes , we can overload the main()
- when we execute the class, JVM starts execution public static void main(String[] args)


- java doesn't have any garbage value
- it throws error
- Local variables must be intialized before use, otherwise compilation fails
